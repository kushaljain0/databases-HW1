|---------|------------|---------------|-------------------|
| India | 1,013,662,000 | 301,297 | 0.03% |
| United States | 278,357,000 | 572,059 | 0.21% |
| Nigeria | 111,506,000 | 350,100 | 0.31% |
| Pakistan | 156,483,000 | 524,500 | 0.34% |
| Tanzania | 33,517,000 | 189,000 | 0.56% |
| China | 1,277,558,000 | 7,472,000 | 0.58% |
| Guam | 168,000 | 1,139 | 0.68% |
| Côte d'Ivoire | 14,786,000 | 130,000 | 0.88% |
| Bhutan | 2,124,000 | 22,000 | 1.04% |
| Canada | 31,147,000 | 335,277 | 1.08% |

## Analysis

### Population Analysis
1. **Population Distribution**
   - Largest Population: China (1.28 billion)
   - Smallest Population: Guam (168,000)
   - Range: 168,000 to 1.28 billion
   - Significant variation in country sizes

2. **Population Categories**
   - **Billion+ Population**: China, India
   - **Hundred Million+**: United States, Nigeria, Pakistan
   - **Million+**: Tanzania, Canada, Côte d'Ivoire
   - **Less than Million**: Bhutan, Guam

### Customer Analysis
1. **Customer Distribution**
   - Highest Customer Count: China (7.47 million)
   - Lowest Customer Count: Guam (1,139)
   - Range: 1,139 to 7.47 million
   - Significant variation in customer bases

2. **Customer Penetration**
   - Highest Percentage: Canada (1.08%)
   - Lowest Percentage: India (0.03%)
   - Range: 0.03% to 1.08%
   - Inverse relationship between population size and penetration rate

### Key Observations
1. **Market Penetration Patterns**
   - Smaller countries show higher customer penetration rates
   - Larger countries show lower penetration rates
   - No direct correlation between population and customer count
   - Significant market potential in larger countries

2. **Regional Characteristics**
   - North American countries (US, Canada) show strong presence
   - Asian countries show varying penetration rates
   - African countries show moderate penetration
   - Small island nations (Guam) show high relative penetration

## Conclusion
The analysis reveals:
- Inverse relationship between population size and customer penetration
- Significant market potential in larger countries
- Strong presence in North American markets
- Varying levels of market development across regions
- Opportunities for growth in high-population, low-penetration markets

## Business Implications
1. **Market Strategy**
   - Focus on high-potential large markets (China, India)
   - Maintain strong presence in developed markets (US, Canada)
   - Consider market development in emerging markets
   - Balance between market size and penetration rates

2. **Growth Opportunities**
   - Target underpenetrated large markets
   - Leverage success in high-penetration markets
   - Develop strategies for emerging markets
   - Consider regional market characteristics

3. **Resource Allocation**
   - Prioritize markets based on potential
   - Consider market development costs
   - Balance between large and small markets
   - Focus on market-specific strategies

## Technical Notes
- Population figures are in absolute numbers
- Customer counts represent unique customers
- Customer percentage is calculated as (CustomerCount/Population) * 100
- Data represents current customer base
- Countries are ordered by customer penetration rate

## Additional Considerations
1. **Market Factors**
   - Economic development levels
   - Infrastructure availability
   - Cultural differences
   - Regulatory environment

2. **Analysis Limitations**
   - Population data may be dated
   - Customer counts may not reflect active customers
   - No consideration of purchasing power
   - No breakdown by customer segments

3. **Potential Further Analysis**
   - Break down by customer segments
   - Analyze customer value by country
   - Study market growth rates
   - Investigate regional trends
