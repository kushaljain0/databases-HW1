# Task 8: Vendor Performance Analysis Results

## Results Summary
The query analyzed vendor performance metrics in the AdventureWorks database, focusing on lead times, transaction amounts, and order patterns. Below are the detailed results:

| VendorID | AverageLeadTime | StandardPrice | TotalTransactionAmount | AvgTransactionAmount | MinTransactionAmount | MaxTransactionAmount | OrderCount |
|----------|----------------|---------------|----------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|------------|
| 15 | 59 | 26.60 | 1,066,548.55 | 3,378.17 | 2,630,977.10 | 62,926,364.54 | 3,009 |
| 16 | 60 | 38.32 | 316,392.36 | 2,048.42 | 2,821,333.52 | 18,983,541.51 | 3,019 |
| 17 | 81 | 40.03 | 612,084.05 | 5,779.99 | 10,041,495.59 | 49,578,807.91 | 4,131 |
| 18 | 22 | 33.09 | 707,515.70 | 8,061.10 | 2,472,770.05 | 15,565,345.38 | 1,122 |
| 19 | 81 | 38.50 | 800,461.27 | 6,947.58 | 10,068,533.48 | 64,837,362.56 | 4,050 |

## Analysis

### Lead Time Analysis
1. **Lead Time Distribution**
   - Range: 22 to 81 days
   - Lowest: Vendor 18 (22 days)
   - Highest: Vendors 17 and 19 (81 days)
   - Average: 60.39 days

2. **Lead Time Impact**
   - Vendors with longer lead times (81 days) show higher transaction volumes
   - Shorter lead times (22 days) correlate with lower order counts
   - Moderate lead times (59-60 days) show balanced performance

### Transaction Analysis
1. **Transaction Volume**
   - Highest Total: Vendor 15 ($62.9M)
   - Lowest Total: Vendor 16 ($18.9M)
   - Average Transaction Amount Range: $2,048 to $8,061
   - Significant variation in transaction sizes

2. **Order Patterns**
   - Highest Order Count: Vendor 17 (4,131 orders)
   - Lowest Order Count: Vendor 18 (1,122 orders)
   - Average Order Size varies significantly between vendors

### Price Analysis
1. **Standard Price Range**
   - Lowest: Vendor 15 ($26.60)
   - Highest: Vendor 17 ($40.03)
   - Average: $35.31
   - Moderate price variation between vendors

### Key Observations
1. **Vendor Performance Patterns**
   - No direct correlation between lead time and transaction volume
   - Higher order counts don't necessarily mean higher total transaction amounts
   - Standard prices show moderate variation
   - Significant differences in average transaction amounts

2. **Vendor Characteristics**
   - **Vendor 15**: High total transactions, low standard price, moderate lead time
   - **Vendor 16**: Lower transaction volume, higher standard price, moderate lead time
   - **Vendor 17**: High order count, highest standard price, longest lead time
   - **Vendor 18**: Lowest lead time, moderate transaction volume, lowest order count
   - **Vendor 19**: High transaction volume, high order count, longest lead time

## Conclusion
The analysis reveals:
- Complex relationships between lead times, prices, and transaction volumes
- No simple correlation between lead time and vendor performance
- Significant variation in vendor characteristics and performance metrics
- Different vendor strategies in terms of pricing and order fulfillment

## Business Implications
1. **Vendor Management**
   - Need for differentiated vendor management strategies
   - Consider both lead time and transaction volume in vendor selection
   - Balance between price, lead time, and order volume

2. **Supply Chain Optimization**
   - Consider lead time impact on inventory management
   - Evaluate trade-offs between price and delivery speed
   - Monitor vendor performance metrics regularly

3. **Strategic Considerations**
   - Diversify vendor base to manage risks
   - Consider vendor specialization in different areas
   - Balance between high-volume and quick-delivery vendors

## Technical Notes
- All monetary values are in the database's currency
- Lead times are measured in days
- Transaction amounts include all related orders
- Order counts represent unique purchase orders
- Standard prices are per unit
