# LLM Usage Analysis for SQL Development and Analytics

## Overview
This document analyzes the experience of using Large Language Models (LLMs) for SQL development and analytics tasks in the AdventureWorks database project. The analysis covers tasks 1-9, ranging from basic SQL queries to complex analytical tasks.

## LLM Performance Analysis

### Common Mistakes and Hallucinations

1. **Schema and Table Name Hallucinations**
   - LLM frequently assumed incorrect schema names (e.g., `HumanResources` instead of actual schema)
   - Made assumptions about table names that didn't exist in the database
   - Suggested column names that weren't present in the actual tables
   - Example: Initially used `BusinessEntityID` instead of `EmployeeID` in employee-related queries

2. **Query Structure Issues**
   - Sometimes generated overly complex queries when simpler solutions existed
   - Occasionally suggested non-standard SQL syntax
   - Made assumptions about table relationships without proper context
   - Example: Created complex subqueries for Task 7 (employee hierarchy) when a simpler recursive CTE would work

3. **Data Type Assumptions**
   - Assumed incorrect data types for columns
   - Suggested operations incompatible with actual column types
   - Example: Tried to perform date operations on string columns

### Context Requirements

1. **Minimum Context Needed**
   - Basic Requirements:
     - Actual table names
     - Correct schema names
     - Column names and their data types
     - Table relationships
     - Sample data or expected output format

2. **Context Effectiveness**
   - Most effective when provided:
     - Complete table structure
     - Sample data
     - Expected output format
     - Business requirements
   - Less effective with:
     - Partial table information
     - Ambiguous requirements
     - Complex business rules

3. **Iterative Improvement**
   - First attempts often required refinement
   - Performance improved significantly with:
     - Feedback on incorrect assumptions
     - Correction of schema/table names
     - Clarification of requirements
     - Example outputs

### Task Type Effectiveness

1. **Technical Tasks (Tasks 1-7)**
   - **Strengths**:
     - Basic SQL syntax
     - Query structure
     - Join operations
     - Basic aggregations
   - **Challenges**:
     - Complex joins
     - Recursive queries
     - Performance optimization
     - Schema-specific requirements

2. **Analytical Tasks (Tasks 8-9)**
   - **Strengths**:
     - Statistical concepts
     - Basic analytical functions
     - Data interpretation
     - Result documentation
   - **Challenges**:
     - Complex statistical analysis
     - Custom analytical functions
     - Performance with large datasets
     - Advanced data transformations

## Recommendations for Future Use

### Best Practices

1. **Preparation**
   - Document complete database schema
   - Provide sample data
   - Define clear requirements
   - Specify expected output format
   - Include business context

2. **Interaction Strategy**
   - Start with simple queries
   - Validate assumptions early
   - Provide feedback on incorrect outputs
   - Break complex tasks into smaller steps
   - Use iterative refinement

3. **Quality Assurance**
   - Always verify generated SQL
   - Test queries with sample data
   - Validate results against requirements
   - Check query performance
   - Review query optimization

### Specific Advice

1. **For SQL Development**
   - Always verify schema and table names
   - Test queries in development environment
   - Validate table relationships
   - Check data types
   - Review query performance

2. **For Analytics Tasks**
   - Provide clear analytical requirements
   - Specify statistical methods needed
   - Define success criteria
   - Include sample calculations
   - Validate results manually

3. **For Documentation**
   - Use LLM for initial documentation
   - Review and refine documentation
   - Add specific examples
   - Include technical notes
   - Document assumptions
